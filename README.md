======================================

### SetUp

0. Please make sure Node.js and npm are installed in your computer.
1. Run ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies.
2. Copy "config.js.template" and rename the copy to be config.js.
3. Start mongodb service with your destination folder.
2. Run ```npm start``` to start the server and go to localhost:3000 to view the running web app.


### Trouble shoot
1. If you see "Cannot connect to database :(" with error message, it is because you did not configure your mongodb properly. Either your mongodb is not started or authentication is not successful.
